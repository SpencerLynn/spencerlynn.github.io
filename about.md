Hi! I am a software engineer located in the Madison/Huntsville area of Alabama. I graduated Auburn University with a degree in Wireless Software Engineering. War Eagle!

I am the master of getting computers to do things, occassionally cool things. Well, except for when it doesn't work, which is more often than I'd like.
