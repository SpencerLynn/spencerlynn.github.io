Hi! My name is Spencer Lynn. I am a software engineer at Microsoft located in Redmond, Washington. I am originally from Birmingham, Alabama. I graduated Auburn University with a degree in Wireless Software Engineering. War Eagle!

I am the master of getting computers to do things, occasionally cool things. Well, except for when it doesn't work, which is more often than I'd like.
