Most of the hits were from Brazil; in fact, nearly 50% of the hits were from Brazil. ON BOTH SITES. Two independent sites. Both with similar results. Why are there so many views from Brazil. One of the sites is for an application I have that is for retiring United States Military service members. Why would someone in Brazil care about that?</p>\n<p>I overheard <a href=\"http://joshuarogers.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Josh Rogers</a>, who first showed me Google Analytics, mention his own analytics page and bot filtering. I mentioned my site views from Brazil, and he mentioned having similar views from Brazil. If you are truly an astute observer, you might have guessed that either nothing I found by searching Google seemed like an obvious answer OR I didn't look through the search results well enough. Honestly, It was probably the latter one, but I hope you didn't guess that one :)</p>\n<p>I then searched far and wide inside the deep forest of Google Analytics.
