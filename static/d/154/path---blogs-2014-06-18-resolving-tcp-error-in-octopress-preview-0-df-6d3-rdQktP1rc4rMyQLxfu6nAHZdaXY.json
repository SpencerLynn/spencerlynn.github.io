I ensured nothing was currently running on port 4000 and that the Ruby application had permissions to use ports. Still nothing. Like any millennial, I turned to Google. I searched every combination of <code class=\"language-text\">TCP Error</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Permission denied</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">WEBrick</code> I could think of. Found nothing that would fix my problem.</p>\n<p>Then I ran across an <a href=\"https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1395\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">issue</a> logged against Octopress with a <a href=\"https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1395#issuecomment-28758511\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">comment</a> that gave me an idea. WEBrick was having issues, so I decided to give 'thin' a chance. Maybe it would give a more descriptive error message or something to help me resolve this issue. It was quick an easy to install 'thin'.</p>\n<p>{% highlight shell-session %}\n$ gem install thin\n$ echo gem \"thin\" >> Gemfile\n$ bundle install\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>I was cautiously optimistic, but that would only be short lived.

Maybe WEBrick or thin isn't the issue at all..</p>\n<p>My next step was to dig into the 'Rakefile' itself to see what exactly is going on inside <code class=\"language-text\">rake preview</code>.

Why not try a different port? I updated the line:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">server_port     = &quot;3000&quot;      # port for preview server eg. localhost:3000</code></p>\n<p>After a <code class=\"language-text\">rake generate</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">rake preview</code> command, I was golden!
